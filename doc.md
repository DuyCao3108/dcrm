# [I. Overview](/2.-Local-Datamart)

CRM LDM is not including behavior data from digital. Digital documentation can be found in this [link](/4.-Global-Mobile-App). CRM Local Datamart (LDM) contain all basic information to support CRM daily task:
- They help to monitoring full flow of CRM selling process for all Product (POS/Cash/Card/HPL). From Offer Creation => Communications => Scoring (BOD0) => Application
- Beside that the LDM also help to monitor Operation process from different selling channels such as TLS/SA/Digital
- For other department CRM LDM can be access under the View will be in schema **DM_CRM_REP**. To access to this schema please raise **Service Request** to get the role **DM_CRM_REP_SELECT** 
- For CRM BI Analyst we have access to both View and Table. View will be under Schema **DM_CRM_REP** and table will be under Schema **DM_CRM**
- LDM is updated daily around 8.AM by Local DWH team. Any adjustment to LDM need to create [Configuration CBL](https://jira.homecredit.net/jira/browse/CBL-21033) and assign to LDWH team for development
- LDM updating process monitoring can be found in [CRM Apps](https://app.powerbi.com/groups/me/apps/e32e5999-2ca5-4ab1-bb12-47dfa84f7e6c/reports/e6a28c7f-c842-47c2-a46b-a77d033149d6?experience=power-bi&clientSideAuth=0)
- List of tables as below:

**Table list:**
Since many report in CRM is using old table name so CRM create a view in AP_CRM to rename columns and adjust defaulted value to Null value to reduce work load on adjusting report when switching to LDM

Vector Table: contains all scoring attributes for a scoring (ORBP) or a application. <br/> Number of attributes is unlimited so that this table is designed with 1 row is one attribute and corresponding value of this attribute for a ORBP/Application

Types of attributes in Vector: Can identify/classify based on attributes full path (with "[]" or not)
1. Array: Multiple results for a scoring
- 'applicantData.limitStore.limits[].limitID'
- 'outputData.onlineRBP.offers[].limitPilotCode'
...
**Note**:
Attribute with path 'applicantData' is considered as Input Information
Attribute with path 'outputData' is considered as Output Information
2. No Array:  single result for a scoring
- 'salesPoint.sellerplaceCode'
- 'sysdate'
- 'additionalData.applicationCode'
- 'credit.offerRecalculationType'

**Note:** In some cases, to simplify the transformation, we are using array attibutes as No Array attributes:
- 'persons[].cuid' -- Client ID in PIF
- 'salesPoints[].salesAssistants[].code', --Identify SA code consult of BOD0

To be able to build and maintain this ORBP table. We have to understand structure of Vector table, which was described below.
